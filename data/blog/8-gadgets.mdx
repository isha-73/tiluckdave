Hi, <br/>
I am Tilak and this is my blog.

Gadgets are nowadays an important part of everyone's life. We use mobile phones, television, and so other things. But, what are the top gadgets which every student should have? These gadgets can help increase ease in a student's life.

Being a college student I have made this list considering college students only! I also tried to make it as comprehensive as possible with miminum spend ammount.

### 1. Smartwatch
A smart accessory which can help you to monitor your daily activities, track sleep patterns, and much more. A smartwatch is a wearable device that can be worn on the wrist which connects with your smartphone using Bluetooth.

### 2. A good Speaker
Nothing more relaxing than listening to your favorite music on loud speakers after you return from your college or work. It can even be used to watch movies, videos with your friends at hostel.

### 3. Headphones
Spakers are not a replaement for headphones. They are a great way to listen to music and movies without disturbing others.

### 4. Table Lamp
A good table lamp to help you study in dark areas. Most of the hostels do not have good lighting conditions at times a table lamp helps a lot.

### 5. Microphone
We have seen the lockdown where meetings, classes, get togethers everything was done online. This is not going to die. Hence I feel investing in a good microphone is a good choice. Clear and loud voice can make all the difference to your online gatherings. It also helps you to create content if you wish to.

### 6. External keyboard/mouse
Usually students use laptops as it is easy to carry to the college. But when you are at your hostel/home you can use external keyboard and mouse. External mouse increases the speed of navigation and external keyboard gives you extra keys and lets you enhance your tying experience.

### 7. Bagpack
A good quality bagpack which can hold everything from laptop to books to clothes. It should be big enough to suit your needs. It should be lightweight and durable. Go for black or brown colors and it will be a great choice.

### 8. Powerbank
Phone's battery can run out any time and you might not have a place to charge your phone. A powerbank helps a lot in such situations. It can be used to charge your phone and also to charge your laptop.
